## Nuxt Boilerplate 🚀

## Overview 🌟

This repository provides a **Nuxt.js Boilerplate** – a pre-configured starter template designed to kickstart your web development projects with Nuxt.js. It comes with essential configurations and common directory structures, allowing you to jump straight into building your application without the initial setup overhead. This boilerplate emphasizes a modern development workflow with TypeScript and streamlined styling.

## Features ✨

This boilerplate is set up to provide a strong foundation with features typically including:

- **Nuxt.js Framework**: Leverages the power of Nuxt.js for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), routing, and more.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully configured for type-safe development, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
- **Pre-configured Styling**: Includes a basic CSS setup, ready for customization.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Integrated for consistent code formatting and linting, ensuring code quality across the team.
- **Organized Structure**: Standard Nuxt.js directory layout for components, pages, layouts, and utilities, promoting maintainable code.
- **Development & Build Scripts**: Ready-to-use scripts for local development and production builds.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This boilerplate is built upon a robust and modern stack:

- **Nuxt.js**: The intuitive and powerful open-source framework for building web applications with Vue.js.
- **Vue.js**: The progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, offering better scalability and error checking.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: The foundational language for web interactivity.

## Installation & Setup 🚀

To start a new project using this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites:

   - Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
   - npm or Yarn: Node.js installation typically includes npm. You can also install Yarn if you prefer.

2. Clone the Repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/SethyRung/Nuxt-Boilerplate.git`

3. Navigate to Project Directory:

   `cd Nuxt-Boilerplate`

4. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

5. Start the Development Server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port).

## Usage & Development 💻

Once the development server is running, you can start building your application:

- **Creating Pages**: Add `.vue` files inside the `pages/` directory to create new routes.
- **Components**: Develop reusable Vue components in the `components/` directory.
- **Layouts**: Define common page structures in `layouts/`.
- **API Routes**: Use the `server/api/` directory for backend API routes (powered by Nitro).
- **Utilities**: Place helper functions in the `utils/` directory.

### Build for Production 📦

To build the application for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command will compile your application into a production-ready build in the `.output/` directory.

### Start Production Server (if SSR/Server API used) ▶️

If your application uses server-side rendering or server API routes:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

This command starts the production server.

## Project Structure 📁

The boilerplate follows a standard Nuxt.js project structure:

```bash
